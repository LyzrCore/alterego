# Project AlterEgo ðŸ˜Ž

Welcome to Project AlterEgo! This is a pet project that I have been working on since I learned how to code with GPT API. But this project is now becoming a reality with Lyzr AI's New Powerful Agent API (currently in private preview).

Our recent success with [Jazon](https://www.lyzr.ai/jazon/) and [Skott](https://www.lyzr.ai/skott/) has further fueled my motivation to bring the AlterEgo project to life.

## What is AlterEgo?

AlterEgo is designed to be your digital counterpart, capable of understanding and mimicking your behavior and decision-making process. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

### Learning Part ðŸ“–

1. **Understand your personality**
2. **Understand your decision-making process**
3. **Build a copy of your memory**
4. **Learn how you react to things around you**

### Execution Part ðŸ§ 

1. **Start interacting with people around you**
2. **Start making smaller decisions on your behalf**
3. **Act as a counselor for you to brainstorm**

## Open Source

I plan to open-source this project once it's ready. The first version is expected to be released in about 3 weeks. Stay tuned for updates!

*This project is a testament to the capabilities of Lyzr AI and the potential of integrating AI into our daily lives. Your feedback and contributions are welcome once the project is released.*

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
